# Running the Program

This program can only run on Windows for now due to linker issues with the SDL2 library on Mac.

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/adarshk-5/CS-128-H-Final-Project.git` to clone the repository.
2. Run `cd .\CS-128-H-Final-Project\code` to navigate to the "code" folder of the repository.
3. Run `cargo run [filepath]`. We've only attached the "BombSweeper.nes" ROM to this repository since it's public domain, but you can always add your own ROMs to this folder. So, for now, you may run `cargo run BombSweeper.nes`.
4. Have fun!
